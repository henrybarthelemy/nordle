# nordle

Nordle Project based off the viral game "Wordle".

Made as a project in Northeasterns Accelerated Fundamentals of Computer Science 2 (CS2510a). Uses a lot of unit tests in a custom testing library given to us.

Code is stored in one class file as it was required per the assignment. Utilizes customly made linked lists of generic type, function objects, and visitor patterns.
